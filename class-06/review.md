# Review CSS

- Doodle around and see things live
- text-aligh: cetner;
- Organization layers how to keep web page organized.
- Had fun with color:  Like the variety colors
- Can use 3 different values for colors.  Hex, name, and rgb value.
- Good examples
- Frustrating looking up different things.
